## Lesson



### Start a repository for the page on github

* Go to https://github.com and  log in with your account
* Click on "Start a project"
* Pick a (short) name, e.g. my-first-webpage; add a description if you'd like; leave the site public
* Check the "Initialize with Readme" option. Under "Add .gitignore" choose "Jekyll"
* Click "Create repository" to do just that

### Set up the page on github
* Your new repository will open on github
* Click on "Settings" at the top
* Under GitHub Pages, towards the bottom of the screen select "master branch" and click "Save".
  * **Quick Challenge**: github lets you choose between the master branch or a "Doc folder" within that branch. When would you consider choosing the Doc folder?
  * *Solution* The Doc folder is particularly useful when you are writing documentation to a project. That way, you can keep the code in the master branch and have the documentation in a subfolder.
* Pick a theme (any theme will do -- pick your favorite!)
