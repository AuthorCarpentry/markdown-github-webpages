#  Getting Started with Markdown
?? Minutes

-------------------------

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the rationale for Markdown
* Create a github account
* Create a very Markdown file on github
* Learn about some other options for editors writing github

----------------------------------------------------

## Motivations for the Markdown and github pages Lesson
* Markdown makes it very easy to write structured text that can be converted easily into all types of different formats
* Markdown is plain text, which means you can read and write it with every text editor. You can also pretty easily see what changed between two different version of a Markdown file.
* github is a platform for hosting and sharing code and, increasingly, other forms of work -- including *Author Carpentry*!
* Markdown is also a sort of "lingua franca" of github: e.g. all comments and Readme files are written in Markdown
* With the help of markdown and github, you can quickly build a modern, custom website.


## Before we get started

* Create a github account if you do not have one already
  * go to [github.com](https://github.com) and pick a username and password to create an account
* You should have a good text editor. [Atom](http://atom.io/) is a free an open source editor with excellent markdown support that we highly recommend you install and use
  * If you do not want to install atom, many other good editors such as TextWrangler/BBEdit, Sublime, or Notepad++ work, too. There are also great online editors such as [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/), and [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) though we suggest you use a local tool here.

## What is Markdown?
There are many forms of Markdown you are likely familiar with by name. For example,


## Basics of Markdown

The most basic "markup" of a text are bold and italics. In markdown, these are created using a single asterisk for \*italics\*  and two asterisks for \*\*bold\*\*.

### Excercise

Create your first text in markdown. Go to the free online markdown editor at [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/). Write a couple of words including bold and italics. Try inserting multiple spaces between words. What happens? Try inserting multiple linebreaks between two lines. What do you notice?
What happens when you "forget" an asterisk on one side of an italicized or bolded expression?
