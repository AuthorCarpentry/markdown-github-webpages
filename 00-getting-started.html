<h2>Motivations for the Markdown and github pages Lesson</h2>

<ul>
<li>Markdown makes it very easy to write structured text that can be converted easily into all types of different formats</li>
<li>Markdown is plain text, which means you can read and write it with every text editor. You can also pretty easily see what changed between two different version of a Markdown file.</li>
<li>github is a platform for hosting and sharing code and, increasingly, other forms of work &ndash; including <em>Author Carpentry</em>!</li>
<li>Markdown is also a sort of &ldquo;lingua franca&rdquo; of github: e.g. all comments and Readme files are written in Markdown</li>
<li>With the help of markdown and github, you can quickly build a modern, custom website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before we get started</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a github account if you do not have one already

<ul>
<li>go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and pick a username and password to create an account</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should have a good text editor. <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a> is a free an open source editor with excellent markdown support that we highly recommend you install and use

<ul>
<li>If you do not want to install atom, many other good editors such as TextWrangler/BBEdit, Sublime, or Notepad++ work, too. There are also great online editors such as <a href="https://hackmd.io/">hackmd</a>, and <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a> though we suggest you use a local tool here.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Markdown?</h2>

<p>There are many forms of Markdown you are likely familiar with by name. For example,</p>

<h2>Basics of Markdown</h2>

<p>The most basic &ldquo;markup&rdquo; of a text are bold and italics. In markdown, these are created using a single asterisk for *italics*  and two asterisks for **bold**.</p>

<h3>Excercise</h3>

<p>Create your first text in markdown. Go to the free online markdown editor at <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a>. Write a couple of words including bold and italics. Try inserting multiple spaces between words. What happens? Try inserting multiple linebreaks between two lines. What do you notice?
What happens when you &ldquo;forget&rdquo; an asterisk on one side of an italicized or bolded expression?</p>

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<li>Add resources on history of markdown here</li>
